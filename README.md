# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern_Task2


This project demonstrates the use of a Text-to-Image Generation model, enabling the creation of high-quality images based on textual prompts. Utilizing Hugging Face's pretrained stable-diffusion-2 model, the application generates images directly from user-provided descriptions.

**Model Description**

This project uses the stable-diffusion-2 model, a scaled-down version of OpenAI’s stable-diffusion-2, for generating images from text prompts. The pretrained model is accessed via Hugging Face’s Transformers library.

**Input**: A textual description or prompt.
**Output**: An image representing the input text.
